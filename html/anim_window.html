<P>The Animation window provides a way to animate the tube hits of
an individual event according to their actual hit times. As an example,
the animation below shows a through-going muon from run 15944.

<P><B><font color="#006000">Note:</font></B> All times are specified in percent
(%) of the full range of TAC times for the specific event being viewed.
If the data displayed is uncalibrated then raw TAC values are used, otherwise
calibrated times are used.  The first hit of an event occurs at 0% on this
scale, and the last hit occurs at 100%.

<P>The <B>Hit Time</B> slider provides manual control of the current hit time
as well as providing a time indicator when an animation is in progress.
The time window is applied automatically if not done already when the slider
position is changed.

<P>The <B>Time Window</B> specifies the width of the time window for visible hits. 
A value of 100 causes all tube hits before the current hit time (as specified by
the slider position) to be displayed.  Smaller widths cause only hits which are
closer to the current hit time to be shown.  A negative width may be specified,
in which case hits after the current time are displayed (instead of before, as
with a positive width value).  Pressing return in this field causes the current
time window to be applied.

<P>The <B>Apply Window</B> checkbox allows the time window to be turned on
and off.  When on, only hits within the specified time window are displayed.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="xsnoed_animation.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=302 WIDTH=305 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>

<P><B>Start Time</B> specifies the starting time for the animation sequence.
This is a floating point number between 0 and 100.

<P><B>End Time</B> specifies the ending time for the animation sequence.

<P><B>Number of Frames</B> gives the number of frames for the animation.
The actual number of frames generated is one greater than this value to allow
the time interval to be evenly divided with a frame at each end.

<P><B>Delay</B> is the delay time in seconds between frames.  If an animated gif is
created, this delay time is written into the file, otherwise it it used
as a wait time between the generated images.

<P>If <B>Write Animated GIF</B> is checked, then the specified animated gif output file
is written to disk.  The animation is generated from the images in the main window.
Internally, individual frames are written as .bmp files which are deleted
after they are used to create the animated gif file.

<P>The <B>Animate</B> button causes the animation to begin.  This causes
the slider to move automatically through the specified range of hit times,
and writes an animated gif output file if selected.

<P>Clicking on <B>Done</B> dismisses this window, and causes all hits
in the current event to be displayed.

<P><B><font color="#006000">Note:</font></B> Currently, the settings in this
window are not persistent, and will revert back to the defaults if the window
is closed.
