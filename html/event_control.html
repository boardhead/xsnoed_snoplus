<H1>Event Control Window</H1>
<HR>

<IMG SRC="event_control.GIF" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=336 WIDTH=362 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT>

<P>The Event Control window allows you to control the events displayed.

<P>This window pops up automatically when an event file is opened or a
dispatcher connection is made. It can also be selected through the
<A HREF="file.html">File Menu</A>.

<P>Clicking on <B>Next</B> causes the next event matching the filter settings
to be displayed. Events are read from the file or dispatcher until a matching
event is found. If the end of file is reached, the event control automatically
switches to <B>Off</B> and file is rewound to the beginning. (Note: When reading
SNO ZDAB data, XSNOED will read across sub-run files and will only rewind to
sub-run 000 if no more sub-runs are available). Clicking on <B>Continuous</B>
causes the display to be continuously updated with new events at the interval
specified by the <B>Period</B> slider. With <B>Continuous</B> selected,
XSNOED either suspends reading of the input file, or discards incoming dispatcher
data for the specified period after displaying each event. An exception is
when summing events. In sum mode, XSNOED reads and sums events as quickly as
possible, but only updates the display at the specified interval.

<P>The <A HREF="#nhit_thresh">NHIT Threshold</A>, <A HREF="#trigger_mask">Trigger Mask</A>
and <A HREF="#pmt_ncd">PMT/NCD</A> settings are used to determine
which events to display. These settings are explained later in this section.

<BR>
<H4><B>History</B></H4>
The history controls allow you to look back at events before the displayed
event. There are 3 separate 100-event history buffers. The first buffer
contains the previously displayed 100 events (the "cut" history). This buffer is active when
<B>Cut</B> is selected. With <B>Cut</B> deselected, you are able to scan through
the uncut history of the previous 100 events read from the file or dispatcher. These buffers
don't necessarily contain the same events if an NHIT threshold was used
to filter events for display. The final buffer is the "future" buffer, and
is a forward extension of the uncut history, giving a look ahead into the next
100 events that will be read from disk or dispatcher.

<P>To maintain this "future" buffer, XSNOED continues to read events from the
file or dispatcher until the future buffer is full. Any messages generated while
reading ahead in a file are queued and displayed as the corresponding event is
read from the future buffer. The <A HREF="event_times.html">Event Times window</A>
displays the status of the events in this (as well as the "uncut") buffer by plotting
their 50 MHz clock times in histogram form.

<P>The <B>-1</B> and <B>-10</B> buttons step backward through the "cut" or "uncut"
histories by one and ten events respectively, to a limit of -100 events.
When viewing the "cut" history, the <B>+1</B> and <B>+10</B> buttons step forward
until the most recent event, History(0), is displayed.  Beyond this, the next available
event from file or dispatcher is displayed as if <B>Next</B> had been pressed.
The "uncut" history maintains a buffer of up to 100 future events that are
displayed if the <B>+1</B> or <B>+10</B> buttons are used to view events
after History[0].

<P><B><font color="#006000">Note:</font></B> The brackets around the index of the event in the history buffer are
round () when viewing the "cut" history, and square [] when viewing the "uncut" history.

<BR>
<H4><A NAME="nhit_thresh"><B>NHIT Threshold</B></A></H4>
When a non-zero number is entered into the <B>NHIT Thresh:</B> text field, only
events with NHIT greater than or equal to this number are displayed. You
can also specify hit types and logic operations using <B>></B>, <B>&lt;</B>,
<B>>=</B>, <B>&lt;=</B> and <B>&lt;></B>. Operations can be combined to allow display
of events within a range of NHITs for different tube types. If no tube type is specified, <B>NHIT</B> is assumed.
Valid types are given in the following table:

If no operator or value are specified, <b>> 0</b> is assumed. If no operator is specified but a value is given,
<B>>=</B> is assumed.  If more than one expression is used, a logical <B>and</B> is assumed, unless
<B>or</B> is specified. The <B>or</B> operator takes precidence over <B>and</B>.  The use
of brackets is not supported. The changes take effect when you press Return, or click on the
<B>Continuous</B> or <B>Next</B> buttons. All blanks and unrecognized characters
in the text field are ignored.  Pressing the Tab key causes the current input to be converted
to standard form.

Note that tube type names may be abbreviated by specifying only enough characters
to unambiguously identify them (i.e. <B>B</B> for BUTTS, or <B>NE</B> for Neck).
Also, the symbol <B>|</B> may be used in place of <B>or</B>.

<H4><A NAME="trigger_mask"><B>Trigger Mask</B></A></H4>
This text field allows you to type in the names of the triggers for events
to be displayed. If a number of triggers are specified, events will be
displayed if any of the specified trigger bits are set. You can specify
that a particular trigger bit must be set by placing a plus sign (<B>+</B>) before the trigger
name, or that a particular bit must be off by placing a minus sign (<B>-</B>) before the
name.  In addition, a star (<B>*</B>) before the trigger name forces the event
to be displayed regardless of the NHIT threshold setting.

<H4><A NAME="pmt_ncd"><B>PMT/NCD</B></A></H4>
This field allows you to specify individual PMT's or NCD's for the events to be displayed.
The PMT and/or NCD names entered are used to filter events in exactly the same way as the
<B>Trigger Mask</B>.  You can even use a plus sign (+), a minus sign (-) or a star (*)
before the PMT or NCD name to indicate tubes that must exist, can't exist, or should
always be displayed as with the <B>Trigger Mask</B> logic operations explained above.

<P>PMT's may be specified either by barcode in the form PXXX, or by electronics channel
number in the form P(####).  NCD's may be specified by string name in the form X##, or string number
in the form N(##).  Note that low gain PMT's <b>must</b> be specified by electronics channel, since
their barcode is used to specify the associated <i>normal</i> PMT channel for these tubes.

For convenience, when the PMT/NCD cuts are applied the names in this field are converted
to a standard form where both the name and number are displayed.  For instance, "PADZ" is
converted to "PADZ(4844)", and "N(8)" becomes "K7(8)".

<H4>
<B>Goto GTID/Run/Time</B></H4>
This feature is used to search for a specific event in a file
by GTID, run number or time.  The popup menu beside the Goto
button allows selection of GTID, Run or Time.

<P>With <B>GTID</B> selected, the Goto button will go to the event with the specified GTID in a file.
If an exact match isn't found the event with the next greater
GTID will be displayed unless XSNOED detects that the events in the file
are non-sequential, in which case an exact match is required.
Click the Goto button or press return after typing
the GTID to begin the search.

<P><B><font color="#880000">Special feature:</font></B> The GTID can be entered in either decimal or hexadecimal,
independent of the display setting for GTIDs. Hexadecimal numbers are
distinguished by a leading '0x' (ie. 0x100 hex is 256 decimal).

<P>With <B>Run</B> selected, XSNOED will search for the next available
event in the specified run.  There are two different search strategies
depending on the type of file open:

<OL>
<LI>If a standard SNO run file is open and the format of the filename conforms to
the SNO standard (SNO_##########_###.zdab), then Goto Run will open a new file for
the specified run and load the first event.</LI>
<LI>Otherwise, XSNOED will assume the file is a summary file containing events from
many different runs and it will scan the file looking for the first event
from the specified run.</LI>
</OL>

<P>With <B>Time</B> selected, XSNOED will search for the next event with the
specified 10MHz timestamp (in the currently selected time zone).  The time
must be entered in the format "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss".  The time is optional,
and if not provided will default to 00:00:00.  Seconds need not be specified.

<P>In all cases, Goto will read across ZDAB sub-run files to find the specified event.

<H4><B>Saving Events</B></H4>
The <B>Save</B> buttons cause the currently displayed event to be appended to
the specified ZDAB file. Currently, Monte Carlo and fit data are not saved with
the event. All unique PMT hits (whether visible or not) are saved.
The output ZDAB file remains open until an event is written to another file,
or XSNOED is quit. Note: Because of the block-formatted nature of ZDAB files,
saved events may not actually be written to file until it is closed.
If necessary, a quick way to force an output file to be closed is to clear the
filename and press the associated <B>Save</B> button.<P>

The Event Control window can be extended downwards to reveal three more sets
of <B>Save</B> buttons and filenames, thus allowing four output files to be open
concurrently. The default file name for each output ZDAB file can be specified
in the <A HREF="resource.html">XSnoed resource file</A>.
