<H1>Display Menu</H1>
<HR>

<P>The Display menu provides control over various aspects of the display.
A description of all Display menu items is given below.

<A NAME="Hits"></A><H3>Hits Submenu</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hits submenu is used to specify the types of PMT and NCD hits to display.
A PMT will be displayed only if ALL of its corresponding attributes are selected in
this menu.  (ie. A normal PMT with an overscale value will be displayed only if both <B>Normal</B>
and <B>Overscale</B> are selected in the menu.)  The logic is different for NCD's however, where
an NCD will be displayed if ANY of its attributes are selected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/All</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Turns on display of basic PMT (Normal, Owl, Low Gain, Neck, BUTTS and FECD) 
and NCD (NCD Shaper, NCD MUX and NCD Scope) hit types.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/None</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Turns off display of all basic PMT and NCD hit types.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/PMT Only</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Turns on display of PMT hits, and turns off display of NCD hits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/NCD Only</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Turns on display of NCD hits, and turns off display of PMT hits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/Normal</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of normal PMT's.  When </BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/Owl</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of outward looking PMT's. Outward
looking PMT's are drawn in the location of their corresponding vertex on
the PSUP for the purposes of display.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/Low Gain</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of low gain PMT's.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/Neck</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of neck PMT's (PMT's located
in the neck of the acrylic vessel).  Neck PMTs are displayed in the 3-D image
and the crate view, but are not shown in other projections.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/BUTTS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of BUTTS (Berkeley Underwater Tube Testing
Sled) tubes. BUTTS PMTs are displayed in the 3-D image and the crate view,
but are not shown in other projections.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/FECD</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of hits which occurred on channels
with no PMT connected (Front End Card Digitizer channels). FECD hits are
only displayed in the crate view.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/NCD Shaper</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of NCD hits where an NCD shaper fired.  When on,
causes NCD's to be displayed if the corresponding shaper fired, regardless of other
attributes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/NCD MUX</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of NCD hits where an NCD MUX fired.  When on,
causes NCD's to be displayed if the corresponding MUX fired, regardless of other
attributes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/NCD Scope</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of NCD hits where NCD scope data was available.  When on,
causes NCD's to be displayed if scope data exists, regardless of other attributes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/Discarded</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of discarded PMT hits. Hits may
be marked as discarded by using the center mouse button in any image window.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/Underscale</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sets the display of PMT hits that are below the minimum histogram x scale.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Hits/Overscale</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sets the display of PMT hits that are above the maximum of the histogram scale.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Vessel"></A><B>Vessel</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of acrylic vessel in the 3-D image
window.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Hit Lines"></A><B>Hit Lines</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of hit lines in the 3-D image window.
Hit lines are drawn from the current fit vertex to each PMT hit. The color
of each line corresponds to the current hit color scale. If no fit is available,
hit lines are drawn from (0,0,0).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Fit Lines"></A><B>Fit Lines</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles on and off display of lines drawn from the fit vertex
along the Cherenkov cone. Has no effect if a fit is not available.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Water Level"></A><B>Water Level(s)</B> - plural for ROOT_FILE version only
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toggles the light water level display. Also toggles display
of heavy water level for the ROOT_FILE version. The light water level is
shown by a line drawn where it intersects the PSUP. The water level is
taken from the water_level setting of the <A HREF="resource.html">XSnoed resource file</A> for non-ROOT
versions, and from the water level database for the ROOT_FILE version.
The water level is implemented in the display by adding a special fit of
type "Water" for light water, and "D2O" for heavy water. As such, any fit
display options also apply to the water level display. Note that both water
levels only appear in the 3-D display (of the ROOT_FILE version), the other
projections show the light water level but not the heavy water level.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Geodesic"></A><B>3D Geodesic</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Displays the 3-D SNO PSUP support frame view in the main image
window.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="3D Polar"></A><B>3D Polar</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Displays a 3-D polar coordinate view in the main image window.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="3D No Frame"></A><B>3D No Frame</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Displays a 3-D view with no detector wire frame in the main image window.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Flat Map"></A><B>Flat Map</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Displays the unfolded, flat PSUP view in the main image window.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Crate Map"></A><B>Crate Map</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Displays the crate map in the main image window.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Projection"></A><B>Projection</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Displays the map projection in the main image window. When
this item is selected, and new <B>Projection</B> menu appears in the main
menu bar. The <B>Projection</B> menu is described in more detail
in the section on the <A HREF="projection.html">Projection window</A>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="NCD Map"></A><B>NCD Map</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Displays the NCD Map image in the main window.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="White Backgnd"></A><B>White Backgnd</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Selects the color set with a white background (the alternate colors) for all image windows.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="Greyscale"></A><B>Greyscale</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Selects the greyscale color scheme for all image windows.
