<P>The ASCII Output window provides a convenient way to save ASCII-based event
information to file.  This can be a very useful tool when manually classifying
or recording information about a large number of events.

<P>The <B>Filename</B> field is used to enter the full pathname of the output file.
If the specified file already exists, new entries will be appended.
Otherwise a new file will be created.  The filename field may be left
blank, in which case output is written only to the console.

<P><B><font color="#880000">Special feature:</font></B>
Adding a plus sign (<B>+</B>) before the filename causes the event to be written
to a ZDAB file at the same time as the comments are written.  The ZDAB file will
have the same name as the ASCII output file, but with the extension ".zdab".

<P>The <B>Label</B> field specifies the event information to be written.
The format is exactly the same as the
<A HREF="settings.html#Image Labels">image label setting</A> of the
<A HREF="settings.html">Settings window</A>, except that the font specification
(<B>%+</B>) and the newline feature (<B>%/</B>) are not allowed.  The default
label is "<B>GTID: %gt Run: %rn</B>", which gives event GTID and run number.

<P>The <B>Comment</B> field is provided to allow additional comments about
the event to be saved.  After the comment is written to file,
this text field is cleared to allow input of the next comment.  Previous
comments can be recalled by scrolling through a history buffer using
the Up and Down keys on the keyboard.  Note that the comment history is
not saved like other text fields when this window is closed.  Also note that
duplicate entries are removed from the history to reduce the amount of
scrolling required to find the desired entry.

<P>Pressing the <B>Write</B> button causes the event information and comments
to be written to the specified file.  Alternatively, you can press the Return key
when editing any of the text fields to perform the same function.  

<P>The <B>Auto-Next</B> checkbox causes the next event to be automatically
displayed after writing event information to a file.

<P>Pressing <B>Done</B> closes the window.

<P>
<B><font color="#880000">Advanced feature:</font></B> To allow access to a set of standard event
classification strings, a user-defined option menu may be added to the
ASCII Output window by simply creating a file called "<B>ascii_window_menu.dat</B>"
and placing it in any of the <A HREF="appendix.html#Search Path">XSNOED search directories</A>.
The file should be standard ASCII format with one entry per line.  The first
entry is used as a title for the menu, and the remaining entries are
the menu items. The text from the currently selected menu item is added to the 
event information when writing to file.  As well as the menu items read from
file, XSNOED adds an additional menu item called "&lt;none>" to the top of the
menu, allowing nothing extra to be written.

<P>Below is a sample output from of a few events using the default event
information (run number and GTID).  In this example, an option menu was used.
The option menu selection appears in brackets after the event information
and before the entered comments.
