redispatch version 2.4 documentation (07/03/03)
-----------------------------------------------

A program to redispatch SNO data to multiple target dispatchers.
The source can be either a ZDAB file, or a dispatcher.  If the source
is a file, RAWDATA and RECHDR packets are sent.  If the source is a
dispatcher, RAWDATA, RECHDR and CMOSDATA packets are passed along.

The program will not run unless a source file is opened or a connection
is made to a source dispatcher, but will run if connections to target
dispatcher(s) are not made, as long as valid addresses are given.

If dispatcher connections are lost, redispatch will try to re-establish
the connection at 10 second intervals for the source dispatcher, or 60
second intervals for target dispatchers.

If the source is a zdab file, no filtering is done and the events are
sent out sequentially at the time interval specified by the -t option
(default is 1 second).  If the source is a dispatcher, the event with
the largest NHIT in the time interval is sent.  This time interval
can be changed at run time through the use of the redispatcher command
(REDCMD) packet.


Syntax: redispatch [-t <time>] [-d <target>...] [-r] [-h] <source>

    -d  Target (destination) dispatcher.  There may be many -d options.
        If not specified, "localhost" is assumed.
        
    -t  Minimum time period between sending events (sec).  If not
        specified, 1 second is assumed.  If the source is a dispatcher,
        then a different time period may be specified for each target
        and the "-t" option must come before the associated "-d".
        The time may be zero to force output at maximum rate.
    
    -r  Repeat source file indefinitely (only valid for ZDAB source)
    
    -s  subscription string (default "w RAWDATA w CMOSDATA w RECHDR w REDCMD")

    -h  Show this help information
    
    <source>  ZDAB file name or dispatcher address.  If not specified,
              then "localhost" is assumed.
              
    <target>  Target dispatcher address.
    
    <time>  Floating point number of seconds between events sent out.


Example:

    For running the redispatcher on surf:

    "redispatch -t 1 -d owl.phy.queensu.ca -t 0 -d localhost loveboat &"


Run time commands:

The redispatcher listens to REDCMD packets sent from the source
dispatcher.  These packets contain a special command string that is
used to reconfigure the redispatcher at run time.  The arguments
used in the string are case and spacing sensitive and must match
exactly what the redispatcher is expecting.  The following is a
list of currently accepted redispatcher commands:

1)  Time Command -- Sets the period between events sent to a
                    specified target dispatcher.

    Format:  "time=<secs> host=<hostname>"

    time - The floating point number of seconds between dispatched
           events.

    host - The dispatcher target host for the new period.  This
           field is optional, and defaults to "localhost" if not
           specified.
