--------------------------------------------------------------
Before attempting to compile XSNOED, make sure you have a recent
version of Motif (or Lesstif) installed on your system (Linux users
can download Open Motif from http://www.motifzone.net/download/).
Then follow these steps to compile XSNOED:

 1) Make a directory for the xsnoed source code, and copy
    "xsnoed.tar.gz" into this directory.
    
 2) Type "gunzip xsnoed.tar.gz" and "tar -xf xsnoed.tar" in the
    xsnoed directory to extract the source code.
    
 3) If you do NOT require XSNOED to be able to read live dispatched
    data go to step 8), otherwise continue with step 4).
    
 4) [Compiling for dispatcher] -- Copy the file "disp.tar.gz"
    (available from surf:/usr/local/ph) into the parent directory of
    the xsnoed source code.
 
 5) Type "gunzip disp.tar.gz" and "tar -xf disp.tar" to extract
    the dispatcher libraries.  This will create a directory called
    "disp" parallel to the xsnoed source code directory.
    
 6) In the "disp" directory, change the "lib" soft link to point
    to the library directory for your specific OS type.
    
 7) Change back to the xsnoed source code directory, and advance
    to step 9).
 
 8) [No dispatcher] -- Edit "Makefile.$OSTYPE_$MACHTYPE" for your
    specific OS/machine type, and make the following changes:
    
    a) Add "-DNO_DISPATCH" to the "PROJFLAGS".
    b) Remove "-lconthost" from the "DISPLIBS" definition.
    
 9) Type "make".
 
With any luck, you will now be the proud owner of a freshly compiled
XSNOED -- type "./xsnoed" to run it.

Note:  On some newer Linux versions you may get an error saying
that "errno" is not defined when linking with the dispatcher library.
To fix this, download and install the updated dispatcher library from
surf:/usr/local/ph/disp.tar.gz.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Environment variables used in XSNOED make:

XSNOED_OPTIONS - Allows you to specify xsnoed compiler options.
                 (see html/appendix.html for details)

XSNOED_MAKE_VER - Specifies specific versions of the makefile to
                  use for different systems.  Currently supported
                  make versions are:
  
    .lesstif - Use this if you are running Linux i386 with the
               Lesstif libraries instead of Motif.
             
    .old - For Solaris sparc systems running the older compilers.
  
Examples:

  - Type "setenv XSNOED_OPTIONS -DDEMO_VERSION" before making XSNOED
    to compile the demo version.

  - Type "setenv XSNOED_MAKE_VER .lesstif" before making XSNOED if
    you are using Linux Lesstif instead of Motif.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Motif for Linux:

If you are running Linux, I suggest that you use Motif instead
of Lesstif.  You can download the Open Group Motif free from
http://www.motifzone.net/download/.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling XSNOED for ROOT:

 1) Be sure you have QSNO and ROOT installed.

 2) Type "make libqsnoed" to make libqsnoed.so. 
 
 3) Type "make root" to make the special version of root.exe that
    supports the QSnoed graphics interface.

   (or type "make install" to make both libqsnoed.so and root.exe,
    and install them in the proper QSNO directories)

 4) Type "make clean", then "make xsnoed.root" to make the ROOT
    version of xsnoed.
 
Note: Between builds of different versions, you must type "make clean"
to erase all old object files (this is not necessary between builds of
libqsnoed.so and root.exe).
